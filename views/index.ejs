  <p>CS:GO HNS is a gamemode that is very simple but is very hard to learn surprisingly, the gamemode is basically a</p>
  <p>copy of the game Tag (Eltingarleikur) where the counter terrorists are supposed to chase the terrorist and try to </p>
  <p>kill them with nothing but a knife while the terrorists are supposed to counter this and run away from them and pull</p>
  <p> some "jukes", this has been a thing since the year 2000 when Counter-Strike 1.6 was released and people still play </p>
  <p> the 1.6 version thousands of players. This gamemode didnt really catch on to Counter-Strike: Source because of the </p>
  <p> game mechanics and people just continued playing the 1.6 version. Then CS:GO got released in 2012 and there werent </p>

  <p> play, you might be thinking to yourself "I mean this is just basically the game Tag how could you love this gamemode</p>
  <p> wouldnt it get boring?" Well you arent wrong but not right either the HNS gamemode is so fun because you are juking your</p>
  <p> opponents and you have something called "Jumpstats" where you jump a specific length to get to the jumptop of the server </p>
  <p> and you are battling for the #1 spot!</p>
